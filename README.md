Task Manager API

This is a simple RESTful API built with Spring Boot to manage tasks. It provides endpoints to create, read, update, and retrieve tasks by their ID. Each task has attributes such as a title, description, completion status, creation date, and completion date. The data is stored in-memory, making this project perfect for learning or prototyping purposes without the need for a database.
