Task Manager API

This is a simple RESTful API built with Spring Boot to manage tasks. It provides endpoints to create, read, update, and retrieve tasks by their ID. Each task has attributes such as a title, description, completion status, creation date, and completion date. The data is stored in-memory, making this project perfect for learning or prototyping purposes without the need for a database.

To start this project all you have to do is pull into your preferred code editor, run the main TaskmanagerApplication.java file, and make the API requests through your preffered application. I personally use VS Code to run the Java all in one place, and I use Postman to make the API calls.
